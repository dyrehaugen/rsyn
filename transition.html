<p><strong>INTRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>Progress without Growth</strong></p>
<p>The ongoing <em>Great Acceleration</em> with loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and urban expansion is inherent to capitalism as an economic system.</p>
<p>Doughnut economics, post-growth and degrowth are new ideologies
that challenge mainstream conceptions of economic growth and
offer valuable insights,
but without breaking the current societal order.</p>
<p>But ‘Green transition’ to sustainability is an illusion.
Decoupling of GDP-growth and resource consumption at
a global level is not possible.</p>
<p>Technological change combined with
voluntary changes in consumption and social practices
are efforts to reduce the pressure on climate and nature
while staying within the current economic order -
it may dampen and delay the breakdowns.</p>
<p>Economic Growth - Capitalistic Accumulation - is a defining characteristic
of Western Civilisation.
As long as Capitalism prevails the breakdowns of Climate and Nature will go on.</p>
<p>But in the end broken climate and nature will undermine continued accumulation.
Capitalism is over when economic growth stops.</p>
<p>New cultures, politics and institutions will have be be build democratically on the
ruins of Capitalism.Change requires us to address these barriers democratically.
Communities that live simply offer inspiration for social innovation in the new era.</p>
<p>The ongowing debate moves on an <em>idealistic</em> level:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“societies need to <em>rethink</em> what is meant by growth and progress and their meaning for global sustainability”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and stops there!</p>
<p><strong>Progress without Capital</strong></p>
<p>The deep structural changes needed affects the <em>constituting features of
Capitalism</em>.</p>
<p>This means <em>depowering</em> today’s capitalists - and
<em>empower</em> a new breed of <em>sustainabilitilists</em>.</p>
<p>Doughnut economy and degrowth are preludes to
the required abandonment of capital accumulation.</p>
<p>We are headed for <em>Civilizational Collapse.</em></p>

elected governments should abolish poverty through a citizens income scheme, regulate against social and environmental malpractice and encourage environmental good practice through state procurement. At the same time, economic and political power should be devolved as far as is possible through co-operatives and increased local decision making. By putting political and economic power into the hands of the people most likely to be affected by environmental injustice, it is less likely that the injustice will take place.</p></li>

“We define a global polycrisis as any combination of three or more interacting systemic risks with the potential to cause a cascading, runaway failure of Earth’s natural and social systems that irreversibly and catastrophically degrades humanity’s prospects…A global polycrisis, should it occur, will inherit the four core properties of systemic risks—extreme complexity, high nonlinearity, transboundary causality, and deep uncertainty—while also exhibiting causal synchronization among risks.” <a href="https://boharvey.substack.com/p/on-the-polycrisis-part-i" class="uri">https://boharvey.substack.com/p/on-the-polycrisis-part-i</a>

complexity tainter energy EROEI: we cannot expect ever-higher levels of complexity to always be achievable. (tverberg)
According to Tainter, energy and complexity build on each other. At first, growing complexity can be helpful to a growing economy by encouraging the uptake of available energy products. Unfortunately, this growing complexity reaches diminishing returns because the easiest, most beneficial solutions are found first. When the benefit of added complexity becomes too small relative to the additional energy required, the overall economy tends to collapse–something he says is equivalent to “rapidly losing complexity.”
simplification usually doesn’t happen voluntarily.
growing complexity is seductive; the overall cost of complexity tends to grow over time.</p></li>

The whole of capitalism has to be pulled down. Else the evil will bounce back
see <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/europe-is-not-ready-to-be-a-third" class="uri">https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/europe-is-not-ready-to-be-a-third</a> :
There’s a parable we tell ourselves about the Ming and Qing dynasties that ruled China from 1368 to 1911. The conventional wisdom is that during this period, China turned its back on the outside world and on new technologies, choosing instead to look inward and cultivate a tranquil, harmonious, static society. The Ming burned their oceangoing ships in the 1500s and sealed the country off from most trade. In 1793, the Qing emperor declared to a British trade mission that “Our Celestial Empire [has] no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians.” That isolationism was brought to an abrupt end when China’s technological backwardness and military weakness made it incapable of resisting foreign aggression in the 1800s, leading to the “century of humiliation”.
That is the story we like to tell, and perhaps there’s some truth in it. But even if it’s just a fable, Europe seems in danger of making that sort of mistake in the modern day. It risks becoming a backward but tranquil society, smug in its relatively high quality of life, refusing to engage with what Macron calls “crises that are not ours”. That strategy might work for a while, as France and Germany buy off the Russian barbarians and make a quick buck selling a century of accumulated technological leadership to the Chinese at bargain-basement prices. But in the long run, a decline into weakness, irrelevance, and backwardness will not work out for Europe any better in the 21st century than it did for China in the 19th. The consequence won’t just be the failure of Macron’s ridiculous dreams of being a “third superpower”. Someday someone will show up on Europe’s doorstep who can’t easily be bought off, and the era of harmonious stasis will come to a nasty end.</p></li>

Branko on Turchin ‘End Notes’: <a href="https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/the-chronicle-of-the-revolutions" class="uri">https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/the-chronicle-of-the-revolutions</a> : Turchin’s model of decay has one variable: inequality in income or wealth. That variable which is often adduced as a source of political discord is given a very concrete meaning by Turchin. (Here, I have to mention the often uncomfortable personal experience when people keen to praise my work on inequality would claim that it is important because high inequality leads to social conflict, yet without either them or me being able to pinpoint exactly how it does it. Now, Peter Turchin comes with an explanation).
Rising inequality means by definition that the median-income person will fall further behind the mean-income person, and increasingly behind the top 10% or the top 1 percent. The median-income person could be, as in today’s United States (a county to whose analysis most of the book is dedicated), an insufficiently credentialed manufacturing or service sector worker; or it could be a semi-skilled laborer in the 19th century Great Britain, or a small landholder in the 1830s France and 1850s Russia. Thus, precise occupation or class does not matter: income position does.
What happens on the top of income distribution? Increased inequality means, again by definition, that people at the top are getting richer compared to the rest, or put differently, that the advantage of being in the top decile or top percentile is increasing. This, as every economist knows, implies that the “demand” for such top slots will go up. If the elite (the top decile or the top percentile) is composed, as in today’s US, of executives, investment bankers, corporate lawyers there will be an increasing attempt to study the most lucrative fields and to adopt the type of behavior (including the beliefs) most likely to lead to joining the elite. If more people do so than there are numbers of elite positions, a game of empty chairs follows. Not everyone among the aspiring elite will make it. The split in the elite, created by the disappointed would-be elite fighting for top positions, comes next.<br />
In conditions where (a) the distance between the median and the top goes up (what Turchin calls “immiseration” although it is important to note that this is a relative immiseration; i.e., the median-income person can in real terms become better off), and (b) there is elite overproduction, a pre-revolutionary situation ensues. Immiseration is not enough. To produce a breakdown, we have to have different elites fighting each other, with one of them enlisting the support of the “people” (or others) in order to win.</p></li>

<p>Societies become more complex as they try to solve problems.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Social complexity can be recognized by numerous differentiated and specialised social and economic roles and many mechanisms through which they are coordinated, and by reliance on symbolic and abstract communication, and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production. Such complexity requires a substantial “energy” subsidy (meaning the consumption of resources, or other forms of wealth).</p>
<p>When a society confronts a “problem,” such as a shortage of energy, or difficulty in gaining access to it, it tends to create new layers of bureaucracy, infrastructure, or social class to address the challenge.</p>
<p>Sustainability or collapse of societies follow from the success or failure of problem-solving institutions.
Societies collapse when their investments in social complexity and their energy subsidies reach a point of diminishing marginal returns.
Collapse occurs when a society involuntarily sheds a significant portion of its complexity.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> State Crisis<a href="transition.html#state-crisis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Increasingly deminishing returns on exploitation of natural resources
trigger state crises.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Societies invest in increasing complexity of organisations to solve problems-
requiring increasing amounts of energy for their maintenance. At the point where
additional complexity costs more energy than it returns, societies are no longer
able to solve their problems via more complexity. Complexity becomes a less
attractive strategy, and some parts of society may make efforts to break away
since secession and rebellion become more attractive. As productive capacity
and accumulated surpluses decline, there are fewer reserves with which to deal
with any shocks that occur.</p>
<p>Growing awareness of the finiteness of sources and sinks leads to
more conflicts, social polarisation and political instability.</p>
<p>There are two broad kinds of crises:
those that occur in conditions of ecological-economic suﬀiciency, and
those that occur in conditions of worsening scarcity.</p>
<p>Scarcity crises occur when population growth and intensification leads to envi-
ronmental degradation, in turn leading to increased conflict</p>
<p>State crises arise when the state starts to become perceived as ineffective or
unjust, i.e. the legitimacy of state structures declines.</p>
<p>Disruption and diversion of trade flows may sharpen crisis</p>
<p>Potential outcomes of state crisis are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repression</li>
<li>Coup</li>
<li>Entrenchment (of the elite)</li>
<li>Reform</li>
<li>Civil war</li>
<li>Breakdown, conflict becomes protracted, violent, and divisive.</li>
<li>Collapse, extensive depopulation, socio-political devolution, and loss of culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Breakdown and collapse are violent processes.</p>
<p><strong>Prefigurative steps (from ecs - to be edited)</strong></p>
<p>To get to an eco-socialist society, eco-socialists advocate working-class anti-capitalist<br />
resistance but also believe that there is potential for agency in autonomous, grassroots<br />
individuals and groups across the world who can build “prefigurative” projects for non-v<br />
iolent radical social change.</p>
<p><em>Revolution</em></p>
<p>These prefigurative steps go “beyond the market and the state” and
base production on the enhancement of use values,
leading to the internationalization of resistance communities in an
‘Eco-socialist Party’ or network of grassroots groups focused on
non-violent, radical social transformation.
An ‘Eco-socialist revolution’ is then carried out.</p>
<p><em>Critical Mass</em></p>
<p>The main prefigurative steps “are that people
ruthlessly criticize the capitalist system….
seizing the mind of the masses of people”,
leading to “dynamic” and “exponential”,
rather than “incremental” and “linear”,
victories that spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Activities that have the “promise of breaking down the commodity form”.
This includes organizing labor, which is a
“reconfiguring of the use-value of labor power”;
forming cooperatives,
allowing “a relatively free association of labor”;
forming localised currencies, which
“undercuts the value-basis of money”</p>
<p>Building prefigurations around
forms of production based on use values, which will
provide a practical vision of a post-capitalist, post-statist system.</p>
<p>“go beyond the market and the state” by
rejecting the supposed dichotomy
between private enterprise and state-owned production,
while also rejecting any combination of the two through a mixed economy.
These present forms of “amphibious politics”
are “half in the dirty water of the present but
seeking to move on to a new, unexplored territory.</p>
<p>Open-source software, for example,
opens up “a new form of commons regime in cyberspace”,
is production “for the pleasure of invention” that gives
“access to resources without exchange”.</p>
<p>Open source software has “bypassed” both the market and the state</p>
<p>A reform of the nature of money and the formation of a
World People’s Trade Organisation (WPTO)
that democratizes and improves world trade through
the calculation of an Ecological Price (EP) for goods.</p>
<p>Followed by a transformation of socioeconomic conditions towards
ecological production,
commons land and
notions of usufruct
(that seek to improve the common property possessed by society)
to end private property.</p>

<p>Complex systems modelling can reveal
new and complex patterns and processes
not evident when studied partially.
Nonlinear systems often feature
important dynamics which would be missed without
bidirectional interactions between subsystems.</p>
<p>By adding accumulated wealth and economic inequality to a
predator–prey model of human–nature interaction
Motesharrei et al.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> developed a two-way
coupled Human and Nature Dynamic model.
The model shows that both economic inequality and
resource overdepletion can lead to collapse,
in agreement with the historical record.
If total consumption does not stay
within the carrying capacity
collapse will emerge.</p>
<p>Results from the model show that an unsustainable
scenario can be made sustainable by reducing
per capita depletion rates, reducing inequality to
decrease excessive consumption by the wealthiest,
and reducing birth rates to stabilize the population.
If such changes cannot be made in time, collapse will occur.</p>
<p>Thus timing of counteractions to the current development is critical.
When we are too late breakdown is imminent.</p>

<p>The global economy is split regarding how economies and natural resources interact.
Two different self-reinforcing feedback regimes exist.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>With “green-loop” feedbacks, economies depend directly on local ecosystems
with visible environmental impacts.</p>
<p>With “red-loop” feedbacks, economies depend more on distant ecosystems
with hidden environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The red loop, occurs when economies industrialize and urbanize. When
entering the red loop, the dominant drivers of social–ecological interactions
shift from ecosystem- based production (and a strong, direct reliance on local
ecosystem services) to nonecosystem-based production, an increasing demand
for nonecosystem services, and spatial upscaling of resource use due to increased
reliance on nonlocal ecosystem services.</p>
<p>The green loop, occurs when the economies of countries with growing popula-
tions remain directly reliant on ecosystem goods. This situation is typical of
nations in which a majority of people depend directly on natural resources (e.g.,
agriculture, forests, or fishing). Increasing populations and traditional cultural
practices (e.g., inherited land is divided between surviving children) often lead
to reduced per capita resource availability, and typical wealth-generating red-
loop industries (e.g., manufacturing, service provision) remain stagnant in a less
productive economy.</p>
<p>The red and green loops represent a continuum in their early stages, but they
gradually intensify and differentiate.</p>
<p>The coupling between income and population growth pushes countries farther
away from sustainability through the red loop.</p>
<p>Economic growth alone cannot lead to environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Sustainability requires breaking red feedback loops.</p>

interact with the dynamic features of ecosystems and social systems, with, for
example, flexibility and adaptive preparedness.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Tools for solving ecological problems must account for how living systems
possess non-intuitive characteristics.</p>
<p>Living ecosystems are dynamic, always changing, and possess qualities such
as thresholds, cascades, feedback loops, tipping points, lags, and
generally unintended consequences to input.</p>
<p>Living systems exhibit both patterns and chaos, simultaneously, always changing,
but change is neither continuous nor purely chaotic. Rather, change in
complex systems appears to fluctuate among long periods of relative stability,
punctuated by bursts of rapid change. These systems have no central control,
and abrupt shifts can be triggered by a random input
Some feedbacks self-regulate, some self-amplify. Events in such systems can
stabilize or run out of control.
Not all effects are immediately observable; some are delayed by centuries.</p>
<p>Some effects build up slowly over time and eventually reach
a biological or physical threshold, a tipping point at which point tiny changes
can yield a large and sudden response.</p>
<p>Sometimes random events or tipping points will trigger other tipping points in
a cascade of effects similar to a nuclear chain reaction. A cascade can cause a
complete, irreversible state shift in a complex system</p>
<p>Government of economies interacting with living ecosystems requires
development of a quite new breed of dynamic and flexible planning institutions,
methods and tools.</p>
