Its market system continues to annex new, previously uncommodified, realms. Outwards Expansion Colonialism - external trade - global value chains Inwards Expansion Commodification 2.4.2 Limited Liability Corporations embrace new profit opportunities but rebuff the internalization of new costs. As the decades go by, this ensures that the market, as an institution, becomes ever more extractive or cost-shifting in nature. 2.4.3 Enabled Markets We never have “free markets.” We only ever have “enabled markets” 2.4.4 State Markets are enabled by an authority - the State 2.4.5 Rule of Law The State has to be capable of upholding the rule of law 2.4.6 Property The Rule of Law is required to give Property meaning. 2.4.7 Commodification Expansion by commodification - (privatising public services) Technology creates opportunities for new commodifications – and so make property of – more and more. https://dyrehaugen.github.io/rcap↩︎ "],["pre-capitalism.html", "3 Pre-Capitalism 3.1 Feudalism 3.2 Pre-industrial Capitalism 3.3 Slavery 3.4 Industrial Revolution", " 3 Pre-Capitalism 3.1 Feudalism 3.2 Pre-industrial Capitalism The new order of Capitalism emerged in the European burgs of the late Middle Ages. It came as an reaction to the stagnation and violence of the feudaln régime. It came with promise of dynamism, enlightenment (modern science) and prosperity. Prior to the industrial turn wealth accumulated in commerce, mining and (simple) manufacture. A proto-capitalist was Jacob Fugger (1459-1525, Augsburg, Germany) who controlled much of Europeean silver and copper production, turning this into monetized power as when paying for Charles V to become emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 1519. 3.3 Slavery Slavery were abandonned i Britain in 1834, in the US in 1864, in Brasil in 1888. The proceeds from slavery formed the basis for the coming industrial revolution. 3.4 Industrial Revolution "],["capitalism-is-a-legal-order.html", "4 Capitalism is a Legal Order 4.1 Labour law 4.2 Corporate law 4.3 Competition law", " 4 Capitalism is a Legal Order Capitalism is a socio-economic system structured through law. At the base are the juridical concepts of *equality (before the law)* *freedom of contract* *private property* The term “capitalism” became widespread in the late nineteenth century. The earlier term was “commercial society” - for the regime of material provision through market exchange. 4.1 Labour law 4.2 Corporate law On September 24, 1599. In a timbered building off Moorgate Fields, not far from where Shakespeare was struggling to complete Hamlet, a new type of company was founded. Its ownership of the new firm, called the East India Company, was sliced into tiny pieces to be bought and sold freely.Tradable shares allowed private corporations to become larger and more powerful than states. Corporate law empower corporations to make new property of new things that may be profitable for them - (a modern example: everybody’s internet activity). Through lobbying and regulatory obstruction corporations have the power to prevent new commodification of entities that would result in new costs (a modern example: CO2-price). . 4.3 Competition law "],["capitalism-is-power.html", "5 Capitalism is Power", " 5 Capitalism is Power "],["capitalism-is-growth.html", "6 Capitalism is Growth", " 6 Capitalism is Growth "],["capitalism-is-plunder.html", "7 Capitalism is Plunder", " 7 Capitalism is Plunder The British Treasury only in 2015 finished paying off compensation to slave owners for the abolishion of slavery in 1834.

Capitalism develops historically in the direction of ‘the resultant in the parallelogram of political forces.’ Global Development should not be ‘headless.’ We need a strategy to move beyond capitalism - to give Development a ‘mindful global head.’ Here are some ideas. 10.1 HOW TO PHASE OUT CAPITALISM 10.1.1 Strategy First turn extensive capitalism into intensive, then let the intensive variant compete itself away (to monopoly = death of competition) ! 10.1.2 Root Actions Scale back, Scale down, Degrow, Decellerate Disallow limited liability Disallow fractional credit Disallow marketing - only independent information. Disallow inheritance (100% tax) Disallow partial (not full life cycle) innovation (require food/medicine-like side-effects studies) (rquire system-wide recycling integration) Disallow private land. Disallow cross-trade Flatten income and wealth distributions. Fat-tail focused economic policy Make wealth-statistics transparent. Plublish records for all of the fat tail. Refocus economic analysis from ’normal’ middle to power-outliers Reset economic system every 7th year (jubilee) Disallow urban expansion. Disallow un-wilding. Disallow externalities (robbing the Commons). 10.1.3 Actions on the current margin Next threat within the capitalistic logic: Establishment of Amazon in Scandinavia. How to unde- mind the trend? Linked to the precariate. Amazon should compensate locations which looses cur- rent shops - carry the costs of barnch restructurering. Monopolization fee. Wind-Power industry degrading the landscape - we don’t need more energy. Linked to land owner- ship - ownership of l!and does not contain the right to visual (and audio) polution ! Requirement: No-impact: Only invisible windmills allowed (i.e.:none) 10.1.4 Reset Democracy Lottery basaed representation - time limited.

I am deeply concerned about the (insane) way humanity (i.e. capitalism) interfere with nature. In an effort to gain insights in how and why this happens stuff is collected from around the web and put together in a linked set of web-sites. The sites are operated as personal notebooks. However, these days things can be easily published to the benefit of others concerned with the same issues. But be aware - this is not polished for presentation or peer-reviewed for exactness. I offer you just to have a look at my ‘work-desk’ as it appears in the moment. Any comment or suggestion can be mailed to dyrehaugen@gmail.com You can follow me on twitter as @dyrehaugen.
